# 🎉 Welcome to Emotion Sense API! 

This API is built using **FastAPI** and is designed to perform **sentiment analysis** on text inputs. Whether it's identifying emotions like positive, negative, or neutral, this API has got you covered!

🌐 **Live Demo**: The API is deployed on **Azure Web Services** and can be accessed at the following link:  
[Emotion Sense API](https://emotionsense-dvemggcjagcqdxey.uaenorth-01.azurewebsites.net/)

🚨 **Note**:  
Unfortunately, I can't keep the API live indefinitely as it incurs costs 💸. If the service is down or the link isn't valid anymore, feel free to clone the repository and run it locally to explore its features!
